# CGCMS
Compararive genomic content management system

## Prerequisites

1. Linux-based OS with installed Python 3.8+ and conda (miniconda, anaconda etc.).

2. MySQL server

3. Apache2 web-server 

4. Muscle

5. HMMER

6. NCBI-BLAST

7. Perl

8. zlib1g-dev package

In Ubuntu-based distibutions, you can install the dependencies using the APT package repository:
sudo apt install apache2 mysql-server muscle hmmer ncbi-blast+ build-essential zlib1g-dev

9. Jbrowse genome browser v. 1.16.11 (https://jbrowse.org/jbrowse1.html). You can find installation instructions here: https://jbrowse.org/docs/installation.html#download-jbrowse-minified-release


## Installation

1. Create a directory where CGCMS and external tools will be installed (for example, ~/cgcms). Create "app" subdirectory. Do it only for the first CGCMS installation.

cd ~

mkdir cgcms

cd cgcms

mkdir apps

cd apps


2. Create a directory for the new CGCMS installation in cgcms/apps (for example, mygenomes) and clone the repository into it.

mkdir mygenomes 

cd mygenomes

git clone https://github.com/aekazakov/CGCMS


3. Install external tools and create virtual environment.

cd CGSMS

bash install_tools.sh


4. Create mysql user (for example, cgcmsuser) or use existing mysql account.


5. Create database.

log into mysql as root: mysql -u root -p

CREATE DATABASE cgcms CHARACTER SET utf8;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cgcms.* TO 'cgcmsuser'@'localhost';

quit


6. Open cgcms/apps/mygenomes/CGCMS/genomebrowser/secrets.json in a text editor. Enter secret key, hostname, database name (like cgcms), database username (like cgcmsuser), database password and URL to static files directory.


7. Open cgcms/apps/mygenomes/CGCMS/genomebrowser/configs.txt in a text editor. Check:

paths to Jbrowse utilites: prepare-refseqs.pl, flatfile-to-json.pl, generate-names.pl,

path to strain metadata file.


8. Activate virtual environment cgcms-venv, change directory to cgcms/app/mygenomes/CGCMS/genomebrowser and run Django configuration commands

source cgcms/cgcms-venv/bin/activate

cd cgcms/app/mygenomes/CGCMS/genomebrowser

python manage.py collectstatic

python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py createsuperuser (Enter your desired username, email and password).

python manage.py configure_cgcms -i configs.txt

python manage.py createcachetable


9. Run python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000 and open in the browser http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin. You should be able to log in with the username you entered at the previous step.

If test server cannot find static files, check if www-data user can read from the cgcms/static/my_genomes directory (giving rw permissions for www-data group would work).


10. Configure web-server for CGCMS. Open apache2 site configuration file (it may be default_ssl.conf) in a text editor and add the following (with correct paths):

	WSGIDaemonProcess cgcmspy python-home=/path/to/cgcms/cgcms-venv python-path=/path/to/cgcms/app/mygenomes/CGCMS/genomebrowser

	WSGIScriptAlias /mygenomes /path/to/cgcms/app/mygenomes/CGCMS/genomebrowser/genomebrowser/wsgi.py process-group=cgcmspy application-group=%{GLOBAL}

	<Directory /path/to/cgcms/app/mygenomes/CGCMS/genomebrowser/genomebrowser/>

	    <Files wsgi.py>

            Require all granted

	    </Files>

	</Directory>

	<Directory /path/to/cgcms/static/>

		Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks

		<IfModule mod_headers.c>

		  Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin http://127.0.0.1:8000

		</IfModule>

		Require all granted

	</Directory>

	Alias /cgcmsstatic /path/to/cgcms/static/

	

11. Restart apache2:

sudo systemctl restart apache2

Now you would be able to open https://your.domain.name/mygenomes in a web browser.


## Genome import from the command line

1. Download genomes in genbank format (files may be gzipped). Make a tab-separated file (for example, genomes.txt) with six columns:

- path to Genbank file

- genome ID (no spaces)

- strain name (no spaces)

- sample ID (no spaces)

- URL (link to NCBI genome assembly etc.)

- External ID (someting like "NCBI:GCF_000006945.2")


2. Import genomes into database:

activate virtual environment (source /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate)

cd cgcms/CGCMS/genomebrowser

python manage.py import_genomes -i genomes.txt

Depending on the number of genomes, this command may run from several hours to several days. After that, you should see the genomes on the web site.


3. Generate Pfam and TIGRFAM domain mappings (optional):

python manage.py update_domain_mappings -i genomes.txt


4. If have any plug-ins configured, generate additional annotations (optional):

python manage.py update_annotations -i genomes.txt


## TODO: Genome import from the admin interface
